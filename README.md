# Simple Todo App

This app allows the user to create a list of items to complete. It will allow the items to be checked on and off as well as let the user create or delete more tasks as well as add a due date or bypass one.

## Functionality

This app will alow the user to check or uncheck a item on their list. Should they feel thew need they can delete a task or add one. Should the7y click the escape button or ouside the form, the app will close the form but save the pregress left by escaping the form. After submitting a new task the app will clear the data inputted. If nothing is inputted the app will not let you submit anything blank and will disable the submit button.

## Technology

Java script was used to help create classes that can be imported and exported by
other classes in order to structure tasks in a neat and organized fashion. Multiple event listeners were in place so that specific classes could be added or removed to help the app function correctly. The "this" instance was used throughout the project so that multiple instances of the same function were created.
